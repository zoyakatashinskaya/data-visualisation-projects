# Data Visualisation Projects
Here are my projects that I have worked on during [Data Visualisation course](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/visualization-hs20.html) in HS2020.  
For this course I've been working in *Python 3* with [Bokeh library](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html)

# Assignment 1

Task: visualize the population size distribution across all age groups in Switzerland, grouped by different cantons.
