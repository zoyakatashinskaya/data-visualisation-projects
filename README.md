# Data Visualisation Projects
Here are my projects that I have worked on during [Data Visualisation course](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/visualization-hs20.html) in HS2020.  
For this course I've been working in **Python 3** with **[Bokeh library](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html)**

# Assignment 2
Task: visualize and compare the daily cases increase for each of the cantons in Switzerland from June 2020, such that people can better assess the situation in different cantons during second-phase covid-19 in Switzerland.  
Here you can see result in [html code](https://github.com/zoyakatashinskaya/data-visualisation-projects/blob/main/Assignment_2.html).
