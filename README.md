# Data Visualisation Projects
Here are my projects that I have worked on during [Data Visualisation course](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/vmml/teaching/lectures/visualization-hs20.html) in HS2020.  
For this course I've been working in  **[Bokeh library](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html)** for **Python 3**.

## Assignment 4
Task: For this assignment, I had to create an interactive map visualization based on statistics data of Switzerland. The visualization mainly consisted of two layers, a map as the base layer, and circles encoding daily new cases per capita as the top layer. All cantons are colored either by density scale or by hospital beds per capita rate, depending on what mode is chosen. When 'Play' button is pushed animations starts and shows you the dynamics in daily new cases over swiss cantons.
Here you can see result in [html code](https://github.com/zoyakatashinskaya/data-visualisation-projects/blob/main/Assignment_4.html).

## Assignment 3
Task: The goal of this exercise was to display and link daily total tests numbers together with positive cases numbers in two plots, so that when we dragging the shaded overlay in the second plot, the range of the first plot will be automatically updated.  
Here you can see result in [html code](https://github.com/zoyakatashinskaya/data-visualisation-projects/blob/main/Assignment_3.html).

## Assignment 2
Task: visualize and compare the daily cases increase for each of the cantons in Switzerland from June 2020, such that people can better assess the situation in different cantons during second-phase covid-19 in Switzerland.  
Here you can see result in [html code](https://github.com/zoyakatashinskaya/data-visualisation-projects/blob/main/Assignment_2.html).

## Assignment 1

**Task:** visualize the population size distribution across all age groups in Switzerland, grouped by different cantons. Here you can see result in [html code](https://github.com/zoyakatashinskaya/data-visualisation-projects/blob/main/Assignment_1.html).
